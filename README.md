Movie_Recommendation_System : 
It is a simple movie recommendation system project which suggests some related movies on a given searched movie. I have done this project in Jupyter notebooks that are used for all sorts of data science tasks such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning and transformation, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning and for coding this project I have used the pycharm environment which is suitable for creating projects in python language and there by the help of python libraries I have completed making this movie recommendation system project. For the details of movies i have used the tmdb datasets which I downloaded from kaggle and then in jupyter notebook by python coding I removed all the necessary things of the dataset and kept only the important things in my dataset which was needed.
